# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch project created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It simulates a digital canvas where you can "draw" by moving your mouse over a grid of pixels.

## Features

* **Interactive Drawing**: Move the mouse cursor over the grid to "paint" the pixels.
* **Clear Screen**: A button to reset the grid and start a new drawing.
* **Grid Adjustment**: Option to change the grid density (e.g., from 16x16 to 32x32 pixels), allowing for more detailed or more blocky drawings.
* **Rainbow Mode**: An option to draw with a different color for each pixel.
